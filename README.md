# Prime Group Project - Hero K9

Hero K9 is a new, national, 501(c)(3) non-profit organization focused on maintaining the safety and well-being of K9s in public agencies, including police, fire, and search and rescue. They work to connect available grants with certified K9s in order to provide them with life-saving equipment, such as in-squad kennels, ballistic and multi-threat vests, and in-squad door pop/heat alarm devices. They aim to offer additional equipment in the future.

This full stack, JavaScript-based web application will streamline the lengthy and intricate process of applying for a grant. It allows users to inquire about obtaining funding for safety equipment for their department. An authorized signer completes the online application for a given public agency department (e.g. Bloomington Police Department), and indicates which equipment is being requested for each K9 in the department. Once the account has been approved by an admin from Hero K9 and the authorized signer has signed the legal agreement, the authorized signer must work with the K9 handlers to provide additional information about the K9s (e.g. photos and bio), as well as additional information based on the equipment being applied for (e.g. K9 measurements for the vests and squad specifications). The grant approval process is completed when the equipment has been ordered and shipped to the department.
